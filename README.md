QUESTIONS ( for my own reference)
===


1/ What is the correct way to include seed data? ( Gui said to include it in a migration but Im not sure what that means in practice)

2/ What does Bundle actually do? I think that it ensures all your gem files are included in the project and puts all the necessary textin the gemfile lock file but that seems like it should just happen anyway. Do you have to run it each time you set up the project? 

3/ In app.rb why why are there certain points where you use e.g. beers/#{@beer.id} instead of /beers/params[:id] - CHECK THIS USING PRY
